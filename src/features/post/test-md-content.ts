  "Akhilesh, the issue you're facing happens because:  \n- The `\\n` in your value is treated as plain text rather than actual newlines when rendered back into the editor.  \n- Similarly, triple backticks and code blocks may not re-render properly if they are not parsed or converted correctly.  \n\n### ✅ How to fix:\n1. **Store raw markdown content as-is (not JSON stringified with `\\n`)** — just store it in a string with real new lines.\n2. If you're fetching from API or state where `\\n` are present as string literals, convert them back using:\n```js\nconst markdown = contentFromState.replace(/\\\\n/g, '\\n');\n```\n3. Ensure you don't double-escape backticks or new lines.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Example:\n```js\nconst contentFromState = \"### Example\\\\n```js\\\\nconsole.log('hello');\\\\n```\";\nconst markdown = contentFromState.replace(/\\\\n/g, '\\n');\n\n// Then pass markdown to <MDEditor value={markdown} />\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you’re storing markdown in a database or state, try to store and retrieve it as raw text with line breaks.  \n> Let me know if you’d like help writing a utility function to sanitize this!";
